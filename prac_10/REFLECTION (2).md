# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

60-70 percent accuracy 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

If i can break down the task in more detail the estimation will be more accuracy. Maybe there are some backlog refinement i can learn and bring stuff here.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Accurately assess the time required for the project to schedule the plan.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

They can know something that i was missing or not recognized 

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

docstring is always a good way to tell others what this function is about
single responsibility function and method is much easier to read instead of put all things together

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I might add some bonus mark for the extension from algo/leet code

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

do practical with thinking and refactor everytime after done and find some wiki if i have question (eg. i am curious about how sort work and how itemgetter work so i went to google and chatGPT find out how Low-level code implementation work)
